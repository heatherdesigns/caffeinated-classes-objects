â˜• Learning Ruby classes and objects with caffeinated beverages
==============================================================

Do you like caffeine? Admittedly, I do. So of course caffeine is the perfect topic for my first Ruby program using classes and objects. 

The master commit is very basic as my first goal was to create the classes and to see them work properly. Additional branches will be added as the program develops.
